//QUESTION

After they became famous, the CodeBots all decided
to move to a new building and live together. The building
is represented by a rectangular matrix of rooms. Each cell
in the matrix contains an integer that represents the price 
of the room. Some rooms are free (their cost is 0), but that's
probably because they are haunted, so all the bots are afraid of them. 
That is why any room that is free or is located anywhere below a free room 
in the same column is not considered suitable for the bots to live in.

Example:

matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2], 
          [0, 5, 0, 0], 
          [2, 0, 3, 3]];
          
the output should be:

matrixElementsSum(matrix) = 9.

Here's the rooms matrix with unsuitable rooms marked with 'x':
[[x, 1, 1, 2], 
 [x, 5, x, x], 
 [x, x, x, x]]
 
Thus, the answer is 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 9.

//

Answer:
<?php

function matrixElementsSum($matrix) {

$counter = 0;
$bannedIndex = array();

for($i=0; $i<= count($matrix)-1; $i++){
	for($j=0; $j<=count($matrix[$i])-1; $j++){
		
		if($matrix[$i][$j] === 0){
			array_push($bannedIndex, $j);
		}
		
		if(!in_array($j,$bannedIndex)){
			$counter += $matrix[$i][$j];
		}
		
	}
} return $counter;
}

?>
