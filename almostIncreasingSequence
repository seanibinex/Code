//QUESTION

Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether
it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by 
removing no more than one element from the array.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2].
Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].

Answer:

<?php

function almostIncreasingSequence($sequence) {
    
$sequenceCount = count($sequence);
    $counter = 0;
    
    
    for($i=0; $i <= $sequenceCount -2; $i++){
        if(!($sequence[$i]<$sequence[$i+1])){
           ++$counter;		
		} if($i <= $sequenceCount -3){
			if(!($sequence[$i]<$sequence[$i+2])){
			++$counter;
			}
        }
					          
            
    } if($counter >= 3){
        return false;
    } else {
        return true;
    }
}


?>
